	<p>It had been a pretty terrible day- which is to say, it had been completely normal. After seven hours of desperately trying to keep up with the material learned in each class, I was more than ready to go home. At the front of the class stood Monsieur Merlin, who was wrapping up his lesson on the French past tense- something which I had been completely ignoring. It had been a long day, don't judge me. I'd have plenty of time to learn it later, when I wasn't worn out from school. The bell rang, and our French instructor made a brief announcement- except it was in French, naturally, so I barely understood it. I made out the words 'test' and 'tomorrow,' which rarely meant anything good.</p>

<p>As my classmates quickly escaped the room, I walked up to his desk- he'd asked that I turn in my late assignment after class, which I suspected was more about inconveniencing me than anything else. I started to speak.</p>

<p>"Hi, I have-"</p>

<p>He swiftly interrupted. "PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS!"</p>

<p>Oh, right. I had to speak to him in French. I quickly reviewed tenses and sentence structures in my head, and then gave up and held up my assignment.</p>

<p>"Mon... devoir?"</p>

<p>He sighed, likely because every aspect of my French was an insult to his teaching ability. He reached to take the paper, and right as he closed his hands around my vocabulary list, he froze. His eyes were locked on something behind me.</p>

<p>"Wha-" is all I managed to say, before he dropped my assignment and threw me into the wall.</p>

<p>It hurt. I hit the floor, and started to get up- I was pissed. But my anger quickly turned to shock as I saw three men with assault rifles at the back of the class room, right in front of a large, fluctuating purple hole in the wall. The French teacher ripped his necklace off, shouting something- probably in French, I wouldn't know- as they opened fire. But the bullets didn't hit him- they all bounced off some invisible barrier only a few feet in front of him.</p>

<p>"WILL!" he shouted. "DONNEZ-MOI MON SACHET!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>

<p>He paused, and then remembered my comprehension of french language.</p>

<p>"GET MY BAG!"</p>

<p>It seemed an unusual request, but given the number of high-power assault rifles being fired in our immediate vicinity, I didn't question it. I turned to his desk, grabbing his bag. I started to get up, but stopped when I saw them.</p>

<p>The men had stopped shooting, and the one closest to him had thrown down his gun. He advanced slowly- his face completely expressionless- as he pulled out a stick. Suddenly he leaped forward, slashing as his stick transformed into a long, glowing purple blade- it hit the barrier in front of the Monsieur, shattering it. He quickly stepped forward, swinging again, and my French teacher frantically stepped back- into a wall. The blade narrowly missed him, but he started to swing again.</p>

<p>My French teacher threw his hand out- not at his attacker, but at me. He yelled something, probably in French, and there was a sudden flash as his bag exploded with blinding light. Everything went purple- and suddenly there was silence. And as my vision returned seconds later, I found that I was alone, in a room I'd never seen before.</p>
