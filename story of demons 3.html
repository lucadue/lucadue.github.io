<p>	"This is ridiculous." I said, holding up my arms to examine my new wizard robes. Mat appeared in front of me, floating at head level, transparent and half a foot tall. He quickly absorbed my appearance, and grimaced.
</p>
<p>"It really is. Wizard fashion was always appalling. But you'll need the disguise if you want to get far past that door. Nobody can know you're a... normal. They'll tear you apart."</p>
<p>"Surely they're not that bad."</p>
<p>"Some of them are. Just go with it. Don't let anyone know I'm here, and if you encounter trouble- well, that's what the hand gun is for."</p>

<p>I looked down into the bag, where the black pistol lay ominously at the top of an unorganized pile of random loot. Spying a smooth, stick at the bottom, I asked:</p>

<p>"Is this a wand? How does it work?"</p>
<p>"It is, and it doesn't. Not unless you're a wizard."</p>
<p>"Well why not?"</p>

<p>He sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, their souls are different."</p>
<p>"Souls?"</p>
<p>"Everyone has a soul. I have a soul. You have a soul. Hell, raccoons have souls. Some have bigger ones, some have smaller. But they're all different types. They keep us conscious, they let us feel emotion, and depending on the type, they give us powers. Wizards' souls are used to power their equipment."</p>
<p>"So I can't use any of this?" I said, nodding towards the bag.</p>
<p>"Not a lot of it. Some parts have their own energy sources though."</p>
<p>"So why the hell am I bringing all of it?"</p>
<p>"The robe doesn't make the wizard, the bag full of unpredictable magic does. Nobody's going to leave you alone if they think you don't have several weapons of mass destruction in there."
</p>
<p>I turned to look at him.</p>

<p>"Weapons of mass destruction?"</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>"Well, one." he said, almost sounding embarrassed.</p>
<p>"What do you mean one?!"</p>
<p>"They're hard to come by, ok? I'm not the one with a physical body. Not my fault John only gathered one. I told him to go snatch a nuke during the collapse of the Soviet Union, but noooo, apparently 1 ton of TNT is enough." He rolled his eyes. "How are we supposed to be feared if we only have one ton of TNT?"</p>

<p>I looked back in the bag. I didn't see any explosives.</p>

<p>"But there's no TNT in here."</p>
<p>"Well, obviously we've hidden it. I think it's the band-aid."</p>

<p>I rooted around in the bag, and finally saw it. I pulled out the band-aid and admired the purple Dora the Explorer logo on it. "You mean this?"</p>
<p>"That's the one! Useful if we ever need to destroy a city block."</p>
<p>"Why would we need to-"</p>
<p>He cut me off. "It's good to be prepared for anything." There was an awkward pause, and he turned towards the door. "Time to go. You've got the hand-gun ready, right?"</p>

<p>I double checked- it was still at the top of the bag. "Isn't it a little suspicious that a wizard is using a gun?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense. Plus, it's a magic gun. Well I mean, it shoots magic. It's complicated. Anyhow, everyone uses guns."</p>
<p>"Don't they have magic?"</p>
<p>"We don't really refer to it as magic, but yes, they have powers. And they do use them to fight. But if there's anything you humans are good at, it's designing weapons..." He drifted off, lost in thought. Probably dreaming of more weapons of mass destruction. At any rate, I'd had enough.
</p>
<p>"How will I get home?"</p>
<p>"Home? You're my carrier. You don't have a home."</p>
<p>"What if I don't want to be your carrier?"</p>
<p>"Hey, I didn't ask for this either. But life isn't perfect, and there's no one out there we can trust."</p>
<p>"What if I find someone trustworthy?"</p>

<p>He snorted. "Nobody's trustworthy."</p>
<p>"But you trust me."</p>
<p>"No, not really. I just don't really have a choice." He scowled, and fell silent. Then he started again.</p>

<p>"Look, they'll find us if we don't keep moving. They always do. That was John's mistake, he stayed in the same place. If you want to survive, you're going to have to learn how to run."
</p>
<p>I turned towards the door. "But what about my life? I can't leave that behind."</p>

<p>He rolled his eyes. "You hated your life. Why would you go back?"</p>

<p>I froze. "What?"</p>
<p>"You did."</p>
<p>"How would you know?"</p>
<p>"I can see it in your aura."
</p>
<p>He paused, and then continued. "Oh. You didn't know what that is either. It's, uh, basically the visible effect your soul has around you. Almost no one can see it- only the soulcasters and demons, really."
</p>
<p>He squinted at me. "Nope, you're still confused. But we need to go."</p>

<p>Feeling slightly overwhelmed, I turned towards the door. I opened it, and stepped outside, ready to encounter a magical world I'd never seen before.</p>
