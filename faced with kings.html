		<title>Faced With Kings</title>

<p>	I’d just like to start out by saying that there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation behind all of this.</p>

<p>	----So there I was, minding my own business, strolling down one of Erindale’s many packed streets towards the city walls. Nothing unusual. There was one critical detail I was unaware of, however- there was a very determined man on a horse charging up the street behind me. I became aware of this when his horse slammed into my back, knocking me down. Unfortunately my brief trip to the ground encountered an obstacle- a man carrying a delicate redstone instrument next to me. While both of us survived, his instrument didn’t.</p>

<p>	----But that’s life. Granted, I was upset, but the man and his horse were already out of reach. I started to get back up when I heard a yell behind me. I turned, and it was the dude who’s instrument my fall had destroyed. He wasn’t happy. Well, perhaps more accurately, he was pissed.</p>

<p>	“Hey!” he shouted, smashing his fist into my face.</p>

<p>	----At the time, I was wearing a very nice helmet, which had been forged from quality iron by a reputable armorsmith in the town. I was very particular about my helmets; getting shot in the back of the head wasn’t one of my hobbies. But I liked being able to, well, breathe comfortably, so I never got a visor for it; the front of my face was exposed.</p>

<p>	What I’m trying to say is, that punch hurt.</p>

<p>	----I recovered gracefully, though, picking myself off the ground for the second time in less than a minute. He swung again, but this time I was ready- I dodged to the side and connected my elbow to the side of his chin with a satisfying crunch. He collapsed, and I heard a shout behind me.</p>

<p>	“Stop!”</p>

<p>	Oh boy.</p>

<p>	----I turned, and a warden was running towards me. A bit of explanation: the city of Erindale, just like the rest of the world, is ruled by four kings. These kings are operators, which is to say, they don’t just rule the world; they control it. They have powers. It’d be more accurate to call them gods, but they call themselves kings, and nobody questions it. Despite their powers, they can’t see everything, so they maintain a force of thousands of peacekeepers to, well, keep the peace. Maintain order and all that. They’re called the staff, and they have a hierarchy. Among them there are wardens, then lieutenants, and finally generals; but they’re just pawns for the kings.</p>

<p>	As a general rule, they’re all awful.</p>

<p>	The crowd cleared, eager to see what was going on, and the warden ran up to me.</p>

<p>	“Cities are non-combat zones, Ignazio. Surely a level 37 should know this."</p>
<p>	“Hold on.” I responded. “He hit me first!”</p>

<p>	----The man struggled to get up, but didn’t quite manage. I’d hit him hard. He still managed to protest from the ground, though.</p>

<p>	“He broke my- my- my redstone!”</p>

<p>	----The warden looked over, eyeing the crushed remains of whatever redstone contraption he had built. I hurried to explain myself.</p>

<p>	"Now, hold on, I got pushed into him by some guy-”</p>
<p>	“Yes, yes,” he cut me off. “Very likely. I see you already have two warnings for disruptive behavior.”</p>

<p>	He’d already accessed the staff database. Which meant I wasn’t getting out of this easily.</p>

<p>	“Now, hold on-” I began, but he wasn’t having it.</p>
<p>	<p>	“This is your third infraction.” He glanced at my belt. “Give me your sword.”</p>
“What?” I responded. I rather liked my sword- it was relatively new, and made of pure diamond. Diamonds weren’t easy to come by- even the generals, the highest ranking staff members, usually only had a few pieces. I’d had to work for quite a while to put together the funds to purchase this one.</p>

<p>	“Your sword.” he repeated. “Give it to me.”</p>
<p>	“This isn’t in the rules.”</p>
<p>	“Are you questioning my decision?”</p>

<p>	Great.</p>

<p>	“No” I responded, taking my sword out. I gave it one last forlorn look before handing it to him.</p>

<p>	----“Good. If you have any further questions about the rules, feel free to message me- I’m willing to help at any time.” He ran off. Douchebag. Abuses like these weren’t exactly rare among the staff. They made sure to never go too far- they needed us regular denizens of the world to produce their food- but they still did this fairly often. The only real threat they need to worry about is a global uprising against them, but that’s never going to happen. People know of the kings’ operator powers, and they aren’t eager to test them.</p>

<p>	----Well, looks like I’d need a new sword. Thankfully I was already in Erindale- there was a fairly good prestige shop nearby, one accessible only to level 35s and higher. I was level 37- the result of months of work fighting others and gathering resources out in the wilderness. Most people at my level were in large guilds with massive castles and resources built up to help them level up easily, but I’d never been fond of the guild system. Guilds tended to be a little too proud; they seemed to be increasingly obsessed over maintaining the identity and prestige their names carried, and often fought other guilds just to keep their renown. Sure, these guilds were incredibly powerful- the world was dominated by them, mostly because the kings let them exist. But what good is power if you never use it for anything meaningful?</p>

<p>	----I didn’t have nearly enough gold to buy a new diamond sword, but an iron one would do for now. I opened the doors to the shop and walked in. The place wasn’t empty, but it wasn’t especially packed either- while the place was popular, most weren’t leveled highly enough to enter. Most people in here were about as equipped as me- full iron armor- but a few had diamond armor pieces, and even fewer had enchantments. Enchantment tables were hard to come by- only a few existed in the world, and they were hoarded by the strongest guilds. One person stuck out, though- a young boy, perhaps 12 years old, wearing only leather. Two men in full iron had cornered him, and they didn’t seem friendly. I walked over.</p>

<p>	----“Is there a problem?” I asked them. They ignored me. They must not have heard me. I grabbed the shoulder of the shorter one and pulled him aside. They noticed.</p>

<p>	"Is there a problem?” I repeated.</p>

<p>	The men glanced around. I quickly became aware that no staff members were present.</p>

<p>	“This doesn’t concern you,” the larger one said.</p>
<p>	“Actually, it does concern me. I’m going to need you to leave this boy alone.”</p>

<p>	----The men exchanged a look. They weren’t impressed. They both reached for their swords, and I reached for mine. Then I remembered I didn’t have a sword. Whoops. They noticed this detail as well, and grinned. The large one partially unsheathed his sword, revealing enough iron to let me know that they weren’t bluffing.</p>

<p>	----“You’ll have to shove your concern up your-” he began, stopping suddenly, and I heard the shop doors close behind me. I spun around. A lieutenant had just walked in- I’d never been so happy to see a staff member. I looked back at the men- they glared at me for a few seconds before letting go of their swords and walking off, grumbling. They knew better than to try anything with a staff member nearby. I looked at the boy, who was standing there quietly, clutching something in his hands.</p>

<p>	----“What were those guys doing?” I asked.</p>
<p>	----“They wanted my- they wanted- they wanted my helmet” he stammered. He raised the object he was clutching, and I glanced at it- then did a double-take as I realized it was enchanted diamond. But I didn’t get a chance to ask how he’d gotten it.</p>

<p>	“Why did you help me?” he asked. “You didn’t have a sword. They would have killed you.”</p>

<p>	I paused. I didn’t feel like admitting that I had forgotten about my lack of weaponry.</p>

<p>	“I’m not a big fan of people abusing their power,” I answered.</p>
<p>	“My brother was like that,” he responded. To tell you the truth, I wasn’t especially interested in learning about his brother, so I cut him off.</p>

<p>	“What’s your name?” I asked.</p>
<p>	“I’m- I’m Almon,” he said, after a pause.</p>
<p>	Look- I’ve got to go now. Add me as a friend- if they come back, just message me.”</p>

<p>	----He nodded, and sent me a friend request. The friendship system was fairly useful- friends could message each other, see their statuses, and trace their location. I didn’t have many people on mine- I didn’t trust many people enough to let them know my whereabouts- but most people weren’t worth being friends with anyways. I accepted his request, and went off to the shop counter. I heard a familiar voice shout my name.</p>

<p>	“Ignazio!”</p>

<p>	----I turned, and saw Marrok approaching me. Marrok is one of the few people actually on my friends list- well, to tell you the truth, he’s the only one. In my defense though, Marrok is worth more than a hundred friends put together. I’d met him in the wilderness about a month ago when he was still relatively low level, and we quickly bonded. I taught him all the tricks I had, and he learned quickly- a bit too quickly. Eventually he’d gone off and joined a guild, the Knights of Oren, and he’d even passed me in level recently, much to my annoyance.</p>

<p>	“Did you hear the news?” he asked.</p>
<p>	“What?”</p>
<p>	“Cael’s gone.”</p>

<p>	----Now this was news. Cael was one of the four kings that ran the world, and while I didn’t know much about him, he was the only one I’d actually liked. From what I’ve heard, he had made numerous attempts to reform the staff to be less, well, abusive. He’d had limited success, but I respected him for trying.</p>

<p>	----“Cael’s gone?” I repeated, stunned. “Why?”</p>
<p>	----“Nobody’s sure. But his name disappeared off the staff list, and they haven’t made an announcement yet. A rumor’s going around that those that had him on their friends list see him marked as dead."</p>
<p>	----“But he’s an operator. He can’t die.”</p>

<p>	----We were interrupted by the deafening sound of drums. Everyone in the shop stopped what they were doing. We all knew what was happening. The kings, being operators, had the power to send a message across the world, booming it across the skies. This was known as an announcement, and they were pretty rare- I’d never experienced one before, though I’d heard about them. The drums stopped, and a deep voice seemed to emanate from the roof.</p>

<p>	----“For the past decade, four kings have ruled over the realm. They have ruled with justice and honor. It is with regret that we inform you that Cael has resigned his role as king. We thank him for his service, and wish him well in his future endeavours.”</p>

<p>	The voice faded. The shop was quiet.</p>

<p>	“Well, that didn’t explain anything,” Marrok said, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>	“It’s quite strange. Why would he resign?”</p>
<p>	"Perhaps they’re lying.”</p>

<p>	The lieutenant glanced at us. I decided that I’d talked with the staff enough for one day.</p>

<p>	“Anyhow, Marrok, good seeing you- but I’ve got to go.” I said, hurriedly, and exited the shop. </p>
