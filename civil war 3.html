	<p>The three of us warped to the paintball lobby. To our great surprise, there were a whole 4 players in the lobby.
</p>
<p>Three of them were mods, and they had the fourth trapped against a wall. I didn't recognize what his rank was, but I didn't think that asking would be a good idea, given the three moderators. I told xXx_Skill_xXX that we ought to run, but he told us to stay. We stayed close to the portal though, just in case anything went wrong.
</p>
<p>The three moderators looked at each other and nodded. They raised their hands, ready to execute their target. In unison, they fired- the three green orbs of particles combining into one large one and slamming into the poor guy.
</p>
<p>It hit him, bounced off his chest, and dissipated into the air. There was a massive grin on his face.
</p>
<p>[ADMIN] Plancke: You are not allowed to use that command.
</p>
<p>He threw his arms out, and red orbs annihilated the two outer moderators. The third turned to run, but met the same fate. He turned to face our MVP+ friend.
</p>
<p>[ADMIN] Plancke: Who are you?</p>
<p>[MVP+] xXx_Skill_xXX: I'm a really good pvper, and I'm here to help you.
</p>
<p>He was clearly fanboying the admin, but given his recent performance against the moderators, that felt like a good idea. He looked over at me and bajanfan69, who were still nearly hugging the portal.
</p>
<p>[ADMIN] Plancke: And who are they?</p>
[<p>MVP+] xXx_Skill_xXX: Uh, they're some nerds I found and brought with me. They could probably help a bit as well.
</p>
<p>I stepped forward.</p>
</p>
<p>budderbacca24: We don't know what's going on- and our friend, pvpgod25, got banned. Can you help him?</p>
<p>[ADMIN] Plancke: Nobody can join the server- most of the other admins have taken over, and put it in maintenance.</p>

<p>He muttered something under his breath, which sounded suspiciously like "Hypixel goes on vacation for one day..."</p>
<p>budderbacca24: So there isn't any way of getting him in?</p>
<p>[ADMIN] Plancke: There is one rank the admins probably forgot about...</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>[ADMIN] Plancke: It's time to bring in the Elite Team.</p>
