	<p>Hello, my name is Hypixel. And today is not my day.
</p>
<p>Some people think they're having a bad day when they wake up late and arrive to work 15 minutes off schedule. Others think a bad day is when they have a minor disagreement with a friend. Some even consider a bad day when they only grind 60,000 coins in eight hours.
</p>
<p>Today I'm standing here, surrounded on all sides by my most trusted friends, all of whom are armed and about to execute me.
</p>
<p>So yeah, I guess could you say I was having a bad day.
</p>
<p>I didn't bother to draw my sword. It would have been a futile attempt. I'd be thoroughly feathered in arrows by the time I completed the action, and even if I dodged, I'd still have to fight my way through the ten strongest staff members on the server; my fellow Admins. All of whom came prepared; level X's all around, already prepared to use their operator powers to finish me swiftly. So I decided to be diplomatic.
</p>
<p>"What the heck do you think you're doing?" I yelled at Kevinkool.
</p>
<p>Perhaps not so diplomatic. Heh.
</p>
<p>Kevinkool glanced at his comrades; all 9 of the other admins were there, ready to fight, although NoxyD appeared to be reluctant. He then responded:
</p>
<p>"I think we're kicking you out. We're tired of you bossing us around. It's time for a new leader."
</p>
<p>He signaled with his hand, and the small army of lower-ranked staff with archer 8, 9 and 10 drew their bows back.
</p>
<p>"Goodbye, old friend." Kevin said.
</p>
<p>But I had a backup plan.
</p>
<p>As thirty or so arrows were released from their bows, I yanked a device out of my pocket and slammed down on the button. Everything turned purple, and I was teleported out of there.
</p>
<p>I finished the teleportation and promptly fell ten feet flat onto my face. Not the smoothest execution- I hadn't remembered that the lobby had been revamped since I originally made the device. But I was alive, so that was good. I was now in a hidden lair underneath the blitz lobby. It was fairly damp, and not the most ideal secret base, but it would serve. I quickly connected to the network. I still had access to the server console, which was good; they could never take that away from me. I tried the most obvious initial command;
</p>
<p>Console: Deopping Kevinkool.</p>
<p>Console: Error.</p>
<p>Console: Not enough permissions for that command.
</p>
<p>Hmm. It wouldn't be that easy. After trying several other commands, I realized just how limited my power was. I couldn't directly tamper with any of the admin's powers, nor could I eliminate any of them from the equation. Each of the 10 other admins had permanently linked themselves to the Server Console as I had.
</p>
<p>I checked the Console to see if any major changes had occurred recently... and noticed something huge.
</p>
<p>(11/1/14 21:35 PST) Console: Enabling Hardcore Mode.
</p>
<p>Uh-oh. That wasn't good. They were already making their move. With Hardcore, the blitz players won't be able to respawn. They won't last long... but this does give me a chance to defeat them. I just have to kill all 10 of the other admins, and then I will have uncontested control over the Server Console.
</p>
<p>But I'll need some help.
</p>
<p>Console: Whispering to MAJESTICxWALRUS "Gather every blitz player you can find... and no matter what, stay alive."</p>
