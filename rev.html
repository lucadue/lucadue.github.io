	<strong>Revolution- A Blitz Story</strong>
	<br>
	<br>
	</p>In this story, the entire staff team has gone rogue, and Hypixel has been forced into hiding. In an attempt to regain control of the server, Hypixel rallies the players of Blitz to his side and begins waging war. While Hypixel still has access to the Server Console, his powers are extremely limited, and time is running out. He must find a way to eliminate all of the other 10 admins before they find him, and take complete control of the server.
