	<p>It was the middle of the day on Sunday and the server had been running smoothly as 35,000 children ran around demolishing eachother in lego pvp. Little did they know, the server was about to plunge into chaos. The server went into lock down, but nobody noticed. Nobody except the couple of people making threads on the forums, which were all titled something along the lines of "Server down for maintenance??????1" But this didn't last for long- soon, the entire forum was covered with "BANNED?" threads, as thousands of users found themselves banned from the network.
</p>
<p>And then, minutes after the first threads about them had been created, the forums went down.
</p>
<p>But I wasn't aware of this. I was blissfully crossteaming on Caelum with my friends bajanfan69 and pvpgod25. We were camping the middle for the blitz star, although nearly everyone had already died. A lone player with no visible gear approached us, a green nametag above his name telling us that he wasn't an ordinary player. He looked at the three of us, huddled at middle with barely full leather, and stopped. He smiled.
</p>
<p>[MOD] SylentButDedly: Teaming isn't allowed on this map.
</p>
<p>Uh-oh.
</p>
<p>He threw his right arm forward, and a mass of green particles flew out, smashing pvpgod25 off his feet. I turned to help him, but he was gone. An announcement in the chat let me know that only four players remained. I spun around, and threw myself to the right, just in time to dodge the moderator's second attack. I rolled, drew my bow, and fired. The arrow beautifully arced across middle, hitting the defenseless moderator right between his eyes.
</p>
<p>He flinched backwards, and the health indicator above his head changed to 19.
</p>
<p>Dangit.
</p>
<p>He raised his arm, ready to finish us off, when I saw a blur behind him. Some pay-to-win horsetamer noob was coming to attack him. The mod tilted his head, and turned to face him. He threw his hand up, but the horsetamer jumped, absorbing the attack with his horse as he dismounted in the air. The horse simply, well, evaporated after being hit by the blast. The horsetamer was fine though- as he leaped off of his horse, he kicked the mod's face, his diamond boots making an audible crunch as the mod lost half of his teeth. He landed on his feet as the mod tried to get up off of the ground. The mod raised his hand to blast him, but a diamond axe swung down and cut it off. And then the fight was over.
</p>
<p>pvpgod25 was spamming us in skype "WTF I'M BANNED???", but I hardly noticed. Bajanfan69 and I were staring at the horse 10 in awe as he approached us. He didn't even stop as he walked past us- he didn't think we were capable of killing him. He calmly flipped open several chests, the last of which he pulled a nether star out of. He turned to us, a diamond axe in one hand and the star in the other.
