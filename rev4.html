<p>	I went back to RumbleCrumble's point of view, getting the very last glimpse of the battle as he beheaded Fatcake24.
</p>
<p>"Rumble and Omwesolp. Everyone else got killed. I need you guys to go in there and see what's going on."
</p>
<p>They approached the portal. I knew the basic layouts of Project November, having designed it myself, but I didn't know how they would modify it to their own needs.
</p>
<p>They got within range, and I got a clear visual. The portal was activated, and AgentKid was in front of it. He started pouring his console power into the portal, and suddenly players started pouring out of the portal by the dozen. By the time he was done, 72 players had emerged.
</p>
<p>AgentKid then spawned gear; wood swords falling from the sky, gold chestplates, bows, arrows, and speed potions. The army picked them up, and equipped themselves.
</p>
<p>"I don't think they're using the Jr. Helper program for its original purpose." Noxy noted.</p>
<p>"Me neither." I replied.
</p>
<p>KevinKool turned, and spotted RumbleCrumble peaking from a distance.
</p>
<p>Uh-oh.
</p>
<p>Kevin turned, said something, and suddenly there was a massive swarm of Jr Helpers sprinting across the bridge, weapons drawn.
</p>
<p>"Rumble! Omwesolp! Get out of there! I'll try to dematerialize you guys before they get you!"
</p>
<p>They didn't need my suggestion; both had gotten out of there pretty quickly when the army started rushing towards them. I started the coding sequence needed to take them out of there.
</p>
<p>The army surged forward, headed by the five that had drunk speed potions. I dematerialized Omwesolp, and then started the sequence for Rumble. Rumble tripped and fell to the ground. The sequence finished, with less than a second to spare as a Jr Helper's sword slashed through the pocket of air where Rumble had just been.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Console put forward a notification.
</p>
<p>Console: Removing Rainforest from the map queue.
</p>
<p>"What?" Noxy asked.</p>
<p>"They've removed Rainforest from the map queue... it means that we don't have direct access to it anymore. We can't just teleport men in." I responded.</p>
<p>"Is there a way to undo that?"</p>
<p>"Yes... but hacking the system takes time, which we have precious little of. I was hoping they wouldn't start removing maps from the map pool."</p>
<p>"What happens when all the maps are removed?"</p>
<p>"We lose. Game over. We won't have any ground to wage our war on. But that's not the end of it... if they keep shutting down maps, they'll find out where our forces are. If they shut down that map... we've just lost every man."
</p>
<p>The Console went on alert. Three maps were being invaded by the staff. Thorin, Mithril and Docks V1.</p>

<p>How are they attacking multiple maps at the same time?" Noxy asked.</p>
<p>"There's 9 other admins. Every one of them can lead an attack. And when they're not leading an attack, they're designing more codes to enhance their own powers. Not all of them are gifted at coding, but most of them are. AgentKid will be preoccupied supplying Project November, but this means they have all the forces they need to attack multiple maps at the same time. And we can't fight that many attacks. It's 1 against 9..."</p>
<p>"Hey, that's 2 against 9." Noxy said, putting his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Regardless, we're going to have to up our game. We're getting slaughtered... it's time for us to launch our own projects."
</p>
<p>I handed him a sketch of what I had in mind.
</p>
<p>"Can it be done?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Definitely. Just give me a while, and I'll have the code ready." He said, and walked off.</p>

<p> I turned to the computer. I might not be able to fight off all the attacks, but I could certainly slow them down. I opened a direct link with the remaining player base.
</p>
<p>"Troops? We are going to save Thorin."
