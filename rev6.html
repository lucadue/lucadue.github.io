<p>"How did you find me?!" I demanded, very mindful of the blade inches away from my nose.
</p>
<p>"It was simple." Rezzus said. "Every time you used the console, it leaves a bit of data regarding the sender. I just created a plugin to track where the commands were coming from, and then teleported myself in here."
</p>
<p>"But... why? Why did you guys do all of this... just to take control of the server?"
</p>
<p>"You may not have realized it yet, Hypixel. But this server is a lot more powerful than you know."
</p>
<p>I saw some movement out of the corner of my eye. Rezzus turned, saying "Huh?", just in time to witness NoxyD's fist crashing into his face. He was thrown off his feet onto the ground, and Noxy jumped on him. I jumped out of my chair, running to the spare sword I had kept at the side of the room. I retrieved it, turning just in time to see Rezzus knocking NoxyD back and grabbing his sword.
</p>
<p>"No!" I shouted, running forward.
</p>
<p>I was too late. As NoxyD was unbalanced, Rezzus lunged forward, stabbing him through the chest with the full length of his sword. I swung, slicing through Rezzus's side, and both fell to the ground in a pool of blood. I kicked Rezzus's sword out of his hands and across the room, and turned to NoxyD.
</p>
<p>"Noxy..." I whispered.
</p>
<p>He was barely alive. He coughed out blood, and said
</p>
<p>"I finished the code."
</p>
<p>That's not important! We need to get you to a hospital!"
</p>
<p>"It's too late for that," he said. "Rezzus... still has operator powers... you can... take them..." he finished, and closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>"Noo!!!" I yelled, as he died. I turned to Rezzus, who was barely breathing.
</p>
<p>"You are going to die for this. But first... I will take something from you."
</p>
<p>I went to the console, and quickly typed in the commands necessary to take away Rezzus's control of the Console.
</p>
<p>Console: ERROR. ACCESS DENIED.
</p>
<p>I turned to Rezzus.
</p>
<p>"No..." he gasped, before my sword went through his chest. I turned back to the console. Now that Rezzus wasn't alive, there was nothing to stop me from claiming his share of the Console power. A death in the virtual world would only make that Console power disappear, but since Rezzus had entered the real world, the rules were different. I typed in the command again.
</p>
<p>Console: Access granted. Allocating power to PLAYER_HYPIXEL.
</p>
<p>...
</p>
<p>It took a few hours to clean the room and bury the bodies. I gave them both a proper burial. Rezzus may have betrayed me... but he was still an old friend. Noxy... I would avenge him. I took the code that he had finished before his death. I glanced over it, and it was spotless. Noxy was not the kind of code developer to make mistakes. I wiped the tears out of my eyes and turned to the computer.
</p>
<p>The war hadn't been paused while I was gone. The console had faithfully reported the casualties:
</p>
<p>Console: Removing Docks V2 from the map queue.</p>
<p>Console: Removing Despair V2 from the map queue.</p>
<p>Console: Removing Caelum V1 from the map queue.</p>
</p>
<p>Three more maps gone. And Citadel already had an operator on it, accompanied by a small army of players.
</p>
<p>I ran the code NoxyD had given me. It was time to turn the war around.</p>
