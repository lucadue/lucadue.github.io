	<p>As it turns out, he didn't have much to say at all. Really, he just wanted us to not attack each other. Deathmatch had started long ago, and the timer for a draw was about to be reached. I asked him why we were doing this, and he said, and I quote: "Shut up, nerd"
</p>
<p>pvpgod25 was still spamming us on skype, saying that he had been banned from the server. We told him to shut up- and also make an appeal on the forums- but he kept telling us that the forums were down. Maintenance or some nonsense. We told him that if nothing happened soon, we'd just log out ourselves and join him on another server.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, an announcement blared across the game: IT'S A DRAW! The Horsetamer 10 turned to us and said "Find me in the lobby. I'm not sure what we should be expecting." I assumed he was being an overdramatic moron- it was a LOBBY. It was the least exciting part of the server! Why was he so calm about having just finished a game where the objective was to kill everyone else, and so tense about the lobby, where the only point is to sit around and chat? But he was probably seven years old, so I let him have his fun. It wasn't like anything was going to happen in the lobby.
</p>
<p>And then we teleported to the lobby, and lots of things happened.
</p>
<p>The horsetamer sprinted away from the spawn location. I turned to bajanfan69, confused. Suddenly, a VIP in front of us exploded as a moderator erased him from the server in a brilliant flash of green particles. I didn't stop to ask him why. "RUN!" I shouted, and we ran after the horsetamer. We narrowly avoided being hit, but I doubt many of the others joining the lobby survived.
</p>
<p>We followed the horsetamer into the parkour area.</p>

<p>[MVP+] xXx_Skill_xXX: They're banning players from the network! We need to find somewhere safe!</p>
<p>bajanfan69: But why?</p>
<p>[MVP+] xXx_Skill_xXX: There's no time to explain! Well, actually, there's plenty of time. I just don't feel like it. Where do we go?!</p>
<p>budderbacca24: Well, we have to go to a place where no one in their right minds would expect to find any players...</p>

<p>We all looked at each other, and said simultaneously:</p>

<p>"The Paintball lobby!"</p>
