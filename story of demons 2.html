<p>	Extremely alarmed, I put down the bag and got up. I looked around- was this someone's living room? The room was empty, except for a dust-covered wooden table at the end of the room accompanied by a few plain chairs. The only other identifiable part of the room was the door next to me. What happened? Where was I? I began to panic.</p>

<p>"Hello?" I asked, almost yelling.</p>

<p>But nobody answered- instead, the bag just... glowed red. I crouched and opened it. The bag was filled with various items, of course, but many of them didn't make any sense. But before I could investigate, I saw the necklace. The necklace consisted of a silver chain attached to a ruby framed in gold, which let out a red glow- one that intensified when I reached for it. I picked it up, and suddenly the light flashed as a miniature man appeared on my hand, slightly transparent and as red as the ruby itself.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I've never been fond of horror games, and certainly not jump-scares; this was no exception. I flinched, dropping the necklace, and fell backwards awkwardly as the man disappeared. I frantically scrambled up and backed away.</p>

<p>I stared at the bag for a few seconds, and then the red light returned. What? I considered leaving it there- I was thoroughly spooked- but I was curious. I slowly approached and picked it up again. The man appeared again, clearly miffed.</p>

<p>"Rude." he said. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>I was speechless for a few seconds, but then I recovered.</p>

<p>"I'm, uh, Will?" I responded, hesitantly.</p>

<p>"Who? Where's John? I heard gunshots."</p>

<p>"John? Wait, do you mean Monsieur Mer-?"</p>

<p>He interrupted me with an impatient wave of his hand. "Yes, him. What happened to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. There were some guys who showed up out of nowhere with guns, and suddenly I was here."</p>

<p>The red man paused for a second, and then continued asking questions, pacing on my hand.</p>

<p>"What did they look like?"</p>

<p>"Well, they were, uh, in suits. There were three of them, and they had huge guns. They came out of nowhere and just started shooting at him."</p>

<p>"What happened to John?"</p>

<p>"You mean-"</p>

<p>He cut me off instantly. "Yes, him, what happened to him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He yelled something and suddenly I was here with his bag."</p>

<p>He paused, deep in thought. Then he turned to face me.</p>

<p>"So you're my new carrier, huh?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"John's dead, and you're the one he gave me to. So you're the new carrier."</p>

<p>"What?" I repeated. "Monsieur Mer- I mean, John- he's dead?"</p>

<p>He looked at me like it was the most casual event in the world. "Well, all of his weapons are in that bag. Wizards can't do anything without tools. And shooting at someone demonstrates a distinct lack of concern for their well-being, so yeah, he's probably dead."</p>

<p>"Wait- wizard?"</p>

<p>He looked at me, again, like this was everyday stuff. "Well, yeah. His alias was Merlin, it wasn't exactly a secret."</p>

<p>"But... that means wizards are real."</p>

<p>He glanced at me, and then suddenly realized the magnitude of my ignorance. "Oh no," he said, stunned. "He's left me with an idiot."</p>

<p>I still had no idea what was going on. "But... wizards? That means magic is real. And other things. Like zombies, and vampires. What's going on?"</p>

<p>He let out an exasperated sigh. "No, no, zombies aren't real. Well, I mean, they are, but they're pretty rare, don't worry about it. And vampires went extinct ages ago." He looked around, absorbing the empty room. "Which safe house are we at?"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked- it was quickly becoming my new catch phrase.</p>

<p>"John sent us to a safe house. Go get the map." He gestured at the bag. I looked through it, noting what appeared to be several small, purple-tinted glass frisbees and a stick, and then I saw it. I drew it out and unraveled it. It didn't look like a map at all. But the red man walked across my hand and touched it, and suddenly the paper changed, a map of the United States appearing. A red dot appeared in the lower right.</p>

<p>Ah," he began. "We're in the Florida one."</p>

<p>"What?!" I exclaimed. "I live in Nevada!"</p>

<p>"That's too bad. You're my carrier now, it's up to you to keep me safe."</p>

<p>"Carrier? What?"</p>

<p>He sighed, as if this was common knowledge that I should have known all along. "Alright, listen here. My name is Matchitehew, Destroyer of-"</p>

<p>"Matchiwhat?"</p>

<p>He sighed again. "Just call me Mat. Anyways, John's dead, so you're my new carrier. There's people that want to destroy me, and it's up to you to make sure that doesn't happen."</p>

<p>"But... why do they want to destroy you?"</p>

<p>"It's a long story. But I'm one of the few things remaining that stands between them and their goal, and they cannot be allowed to succeed."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, dramatically pausing. "The world won't be around much longer after they do."</p>
